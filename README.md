# COLT - COmmand Line Translation
Colt is a command line tool that allows a developer to automate strings translations for localization. It will parse your existing file(s), translate each string to your desired language, and save them into a new file. This can be a tool for developers who do not have the resources to hire a translator, yet want to make their apps more accessible. Or, for those simply curious at how their app would look in a different language.

# Pre-Installation Instructions
### RapidAPI/SYSTRAN.io Api Key
It took some searching to find a free translation api with minimal sign up. I settled on using the SYSTRAN.io api through RapidAPI, which can be found [here on their website](https://rapidapi.com/systran/api/systran-io-translation-and-nlp). To use Colt, you must register to get a key. Click the "Sign Up" button, and after completing registration you'll see that the `X-RapidAPI-Key` value has been populated on the api page. That is the api key you will use in the following step.

### .colt File
Colt will look for the SYSTRAN.io api key in a hidden file in your user's home directory. Open any text editor and enter the following, inserting your api key value in place of `123456789abcdefg`, and save with the name `.colt` in your user's home directory (Users/yourusername/). You may be prompted that _"Names that begin with a dot are reserved for the system."_ but still use this format. It just means that your file will be hidden. If you need to find this file in the future, you can opt to show your hidden files by typing `Command + Shift + Dot`.
```
[keys]
	rapidapi = 123456789abcdefg
```

# Installation
_NOTE: These instructions will create a release build of this project on your machine so that you can use Colt from any directory._

- Clone this repo
- Open Terminal run the following commands
```
cd [path to colt directory]
swift build --configuration release
cp .build/release/colt /usr/local/bin/colt
```



### SYSTRAN.io
Colt uses the SYSTRAN.io api for translation. A list of supported language pairs can be found here, under the Machine Translation section. https://platform.systran.net/index (FYI, if wanting to translate to Chinese, you must use the code "zh-Hans" with a capital H. It is not listed like this in the pairs supported pairs list.)

There is a disclaimer of "SYSTRAN Platform is free for small volumes and testing purposes, monthly subscriptions are available for higher volumes", however with all my testing I never hit this limit. I'm banking on your project not including Les Mis√©rables (although maybe it should).
